## 📝 Known Limitations

1. **No cloud sync** - Local file only
2. **No password recovery** - If master password is lost, data is unrecoverable
3. **Windows only** - WinForms is Windows-specific
4. **No multi-user** - Single-user application
5. **No auto-lock** - App stays open until closed
6. **File size** - Large due to embedded .NET runtime
